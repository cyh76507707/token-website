    content: "Steemhunt is a community for geeks, alpha nerds, and product enthusiasts who love to dig out new products and talk about them with others.

    content: "Makers/companies spend an enormous amount of time/efforts to raise attention from early adopters because their word of mouth impact is exceptionally high. With Reviewhunt, it’s never been easier for makers to attract early-adopters by offering newly launched products with large discounts or bounties in return for quality reviews that will boost up their launching buzz."
  ideahunt:
    sub_title: "Crowdfunding by NFT and Security Token Transactions"
    content: "The crowdfunding market size is huge with over 30 billion USD. There are already many blockchain-based crowdfunding projects. In order to surpass the centralised players (such as Kickstarter or GoFundMe), we believe that the blockchain-powered crowdfunding platform should provide more differentiated values, rather than just the basics of accepting cryptos, reducing accounting cost, using smart contracts, and taking smaller cuts."
    content_2: "Ideahunt will utilise NFT (Non-fungible token) and potentially security token transactions for the crowdfunding/ backing activities, so that the backer’s actions will be linked with the pre- market valuation of the crowdfunding products."

  token_distribution:
    sub_title: "Transferring Token Holders to Real Users by Utilising Steem Community"
    content: "The most important KSF (Key Successful Factor) of the HUNT platform is to build the real user base and amplify our community activities, rather than just focusing on the future token values. So, we are running a unique way to distribute our tokens - ecosystem and community building bounties over 300 days."

  whitepaper:
    sub_title: "We DON’T have time to Create<br/>99% fictional paper."
    content: "Creating an eye-catching and highly detailed whitepaper becomes one of the most important parts for many blockchain projects. As well as platform coins, many decentralised applications are writing gazilion-page-long whitepapers - most of the contents are fiction and nobody bothers to finish reading it.
HUNT platform is simple to understand, it’s a Steem dApp so there’s no need to explain the blockchain technology. Also, this is a community-oriented project, so the value of the token is highly linked to the community value. Thus, we have no reasons to create a complicated fiction paper, instead we should focus on building this community platform."
